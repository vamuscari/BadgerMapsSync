# BadgerMaps CLI - Application Structure

## 1. Command Structure

### Main Commands
- `push`: Send data to BadgerMaps API
- `pull`: Retrieve data from BadgerMaps API
- `server`: Run in server mode
- `test`: Run tests and diagnostics
- `utils`: Utility commands for maintenance
- `auth`: Authenticate with the API
- `search`: Find items by name
- `autocomplete`: Generate shell autocompletion scripts
- `config`: Configure the application
- `help`: Display help information
- `version`: Display version information

### Command Syntax
- Single item operations: `pull account 208965638`
- Multiple item operations: `pull accounts 208965638 208965639`
- Bulk operations: `pull accounts` or `pull account all` (retrieves all accounts)

### Singular vs Plural Data Types
- Singular form (e.g., `account`): Operate on a specific item by ID
- Plural form (e.g., `accounts`): Retrieve a list of all items, then sync detailed data

### Global Flags
- Global flags apply to all commands and provide consistent behavior across the application
- `--verbose` or `-v`: Enable verbose output with additional details
- `--quiet` or `-q`: Suppress all non-essential output
- `--debug`: Enable debug mode with maximum verbosity
- `--no-color`: Disable colored output
- Global flags should be processed before command-specific flags
- Exit with appropriate status codes on errors (0 for success, non-zero for failures)

## 2. Data Types and Operations

### Supported Data Types
- `account`: Customer account information
- `checkin`: Sales visit tracking
- `route`: Route planning data
- `profile`: User profile data

### Pull/Push Operations
- Before executing pull/push commands, validate database tables exist with correct fields
- If validation fails:
  - Exit the program with an error message
  - Provide a suggestion to fix using the utils command

### Concurrent Processing
- For bulk operations, use goroutines for parallel processing
- Limit concurrent operations based on environment configuration (up to 10)
- Implementation pattern:
  - Create a function to process a single item (e.g., `PullAccount`)
  - Create a function to process multiple items (e.g., `PullAccounts`)
  - The bulk function should start goroutines for each item, using the single item function

## 3. API and Database Integration

### API Endpoints
- All endpoint URLs should be created using api_endpoints.go with methods for each endpoint
- If you need to add a new endpoint, add it to the api_endpoints.go file
- Centralize all API URL construction in one place for easier maintenance
- Follow RESTful API design principles for endpoint naming

### JSON to Database Conversion
- JSON responses from the API are converted to database tables using a structured approach
- The following Mermaid diagrams illustrate the conversion process:

```mermaid

    A[API JSON Response] --> B[Parse JSON]
    B --> C{Valid Schema?}
    C -->|Yes| D[Extract Fields]
    C -->|No| E[Log Error]
    D --> F[Map to DB Schema]
    F --> G[Generate SQL]
    G --> H[Execute SQL]
    H --> I[Verify Results]
```

```mermaid

    subgraph JSON Structure
    A[Account JSON] --> B[id]
    A --> C[name]
    A --> D[locations]
    D --> E[location_id]
    D --> F[address]
    end
    
    subgraph Database Tables
    G[accounts table] --> H[id]
    G --> I[name]
    J[account_locations table] --> K[account_id]
    J --> L[location_id]
    J --> M[address]
    end
    
    A -.-> G
    D -.-> J
```

### Rate Limit Handling
- Implement exponential backoff with jitter for API requests
- Respect the Retry-After header when provided by the API
- Maintain a maximum retry budget per operation
- Backoff algorithm:
  - Start with a base delay (e.g., 1 second)
  - After each failure, multiply delay by a factor (e.g., 2)
  - Add random jitter (Â±20%) to prevent thundering herd problem
  - Cap at a maximum delay (e.g., 60 seconds)
- Track rate limit headers from API responses
- Provide clear feedback during rate limiting events
- Log all rate limit encounters when in verbose mode

### SQL Files Management
- SQL files are stored in the database folder depending on the type of database
- Organize SQL files in subdirectories: database/postgres, database/mssql, database/sqlite3
- Each database type has its own implementation of common SQL operations
- Use the SQLLoader to load the appropriate SQL file based on the configured database type

## 4. Configuration and Authentication

### Configuration
- Implement `config` command to configure the application
- Use `viper` package to manage configuration
- .env should be the preferred method for storing configurations
- If no .env file exists, create one
- Allow for rate limiting, parallel processing limits, and server configurations to be defined in the env file with defaults:
  - `RATE_LIMIT_REQUESTS`: Maximum number of API requests per time period
  - `RATE_LIMIT_PERIOD`: Time period for rate limiting in seconds
  - `MAX_PARALLEL_PROCESSES`: Maximum number of concurrent operations
  - `SERVER_HOST`: Host address for server mode
  - `SERVER_PORT`: Port number for server mode
  - `SERVER_TLS_ENABLED`: Enable/disable TLS for server

### Configuration Precedence
- Implement a clear precedence order for configuration sources:
  1. Command-line flags (highest priority)
  2. Environment variables
  3. Configuration file (.env)
  4. Default values (lowest priority)
- Document this precedence in help text and documentation
- When a configuration value is set in multiple places, use the highest priority source
- Provide a way to view the effective configuration with source information
- Allow overriding specific configuration values with flags while keeping others from config file
- Support namespaced environment variables (e.g., `BADGERMAPS_API_URL`)

### Secrets Management
- Store sensitive information like API tokens securely
- Support multiple storage options for secrets:
  1. Environment variables (recommended for CI/CD environments)
  2. OS keychain/credential store (recommended for desktop use)
  3. Configuration file with restricted permissions (fallback)
- Implement automatic redaction of secrets in logs and error messages
- Replace sensitive values with `[REDACTED]` in all output
- Provide a `--no-redact` flag for debugging purposes (with appropriate warnings)
- Implement secure input for secrets when configuring via interactive prompt
- Support rotation of API tokens with minimal downtime
- Validate secrets before storing them

### Authentication
- Use `auth` command to validate and store the API token
- Authentication is required before executing API operations
- Support multiple authentication methods (token, OAuth)
- Implement token refresh mechanism for OAuth authentication
- Provide clear error messages for authentication failures

## 5. Server and Webhook Features

### Server Mode and Webhooks
- Implement server mode with the `server` command
- Listen for incoming webhooks from BadgerMaps API

- Support standard cron syntax with five fields (minute, hour, day of month, month, day of week)
- Provide human-readable schedule descriptions when starting scheduled tasks
- Log all scheduled task executions with timestamps
- Allow cancellation of scheduled tasks with SIGINT (Ctrl+C)
